        <li>2 cups of flour </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat eggs until fluffy; beat in sugar and salt. In a separate bowl, stir flour and baking powder together. Stir milk and flour mixture alternately into eggs, starting and ending with milk.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake.
